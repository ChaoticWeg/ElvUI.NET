# ElvUI Updater

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/cuw7t2d4e7gv2ax3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ChaoticWeg/elvui-update)

Updates your [ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui) installation. Pulls source code from the ElvUI repo on [GitLab](https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui).

Stores ElvUI source code in `%APPDATA%` and copies it into `${WoW}\Interface\AddOns\ElvUI(_Config)?`. 
Source code can be deleted as part of normal system cleanup if desired (though at time of writing it's only around 45 MB).
